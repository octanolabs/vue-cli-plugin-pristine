## Documentation Driven Development

There are many ways to drive open source development. Documenting the problem in the README gives a middle ground between technical and non-technical specifications. This allows organizing solutions to this challenge around community and documentation.

> [...] a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, thereâ€™s something very bad going on.

- [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) by Tom Preson-Werner

### Conventions and Specifications

Pristine has some strong opinions built in like circleci, semantic-release, npm. So feel free to fork and change it at your own discretion. It is only meant to be a starting point. That being said:

Using conventions, documentation and specifications make it easier to:
- communicate the problem you are solving
- ease onboarding
- build and use composable tools
- promote open source contribution and engagement
- promote issue and feature discussion on Github itself
